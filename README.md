## üìù Description

Glimpse is an AI-powered color system generator designed for creating comprehensive design systems. It leverages OpenAI's API to generate a set of brand colors based on user input, then expands these into accessible color scales using color theory principles.

Key features include:

- Generation of background color and 5 brand colors based on user descriptions
- Creation of accessible shade color scales for each generated color
- User authentication and subscription tiers
- Export options for CSS, SCSS, and Tailwind config variables
- Color swatch library with various color space values (hex, okhsl, rgb, hsl, oklch, cmyk, hsb, lab, lch, displayp3, a98, prophoto, xyz)

The application is built with a Next.js 14 REST API, uses TypeScript for type safety, and incorporates modern web technologies for a robust user experience.

5. Have fun! üôÇ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- The color system generation is handled in the `/api/color-systems` route.
- The OpenAI model is currently set to `gpt-4o-mini`. You can modify this in the `completion` object in the API route file.
- `max_tokens` is set to 100 for the OpenAI API call.
- The user prompt is limited to 200 characters, as defined in the `promptSchema`.
- The system generates 5 main colors and 1 background color in OKHsl format.
- Light mode and dark mode have separate system prompts (`LIGHT_MODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `DARK_MODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) that define the color generation parameters.
- User limits for color system generation and storage are checked before each generation.
- The API handles both POST (for generating new color systems) and GET (for retrieving user's color systems) requests.

For more detailed configuration options, please refer to the `/api/*` route files.
